<h1>Student's Pain: 1</h1>
<p>Hi, and welcome to Student's Pain. Git gud. In today's issue, we're taking a look at the College Board's reaction to my AP Calc AB test.</p>
<p><strong>AP Testing Score Concerns</strong><br>Dear College Board,<br>I recently checked my AP Calculus AB test scores and was surprised to see that I received a score of -52,000,000,000. I was under the impression that the minimum score is 1. Is this a mistake? My AP number is 123456789.
<br>Thanks,<br>Anony Moose<br>My School
<br><strong>RE: AP Testing Score Concerns</strong>
<br>Dear Anony,
<br>Thank you for your concerns. We at the College Board would like to inform you that although we usually publicize 1 as the minimum score, we actually do give out lower scores, though we reserve them for especially atrocious tests. As just one example, we point to your work on Question 1 of the Free Response Questions (FRQs). You answered ‘C’ to every part. Not only is this a horrible misuse of mathematics and calculus, but it is also completely incorrect. In fact, our graders docked you more points than were possible because you included a C but not a plus sign, which was not specified in our grading rubric. Also, your work on FRQ #2 cited the ‘Triple Trouble Cancel’ to cancel three exponents. No matter how complicated it may seem, mathematics is not arbitrary. Our graders understand what is real and what is made up. This ‘Triple Trouble Cancel’, while having a viable name, is not a real concept in AP Calculus, or in any area of mathematics as far as we are aware. This is without mentioning that every single one of your multiple choice answers was E on a test that only had options A through D. The AP tests are intended to judge your comprehension of the material taught in the AP class, or, when put another way, to see by how much your comprehension of the subject improved during the year. While messing around and not paying attention during class, which we know you did because we have access to security footage (how do you think we stop people from talking about the tests), you lost so many IQ points that our grading jury agreed unanimously to give you the score of -52 billion. For a fourth example, on the third FRQ you used logic instead of calculus, following the law ‘if you start with P∧~P, you can derive anything.’ This does not mean that you can derive literally anything, just any logical statement. For example, the ‘answer’ that you derived to the question is not even mathematical at all, it’s just a phrase: ‘All men are created =.’ The use of the equal sign instead of the word ‘equal’ does not make it mathematical, but nice try. Our fifth and final example of your total incompetence is the sixth, final, and hardest FRQ. The question involved a function f(x), but you cancelled the bar on the ‘f’ with one of the dashes in the equal sign to obtain the integral of a negative function. This is not how math works at all. Due to these reasons and much more evidence showcasing your lack of any positive qualities at all, we have decided to award you a -52,000,000,000 on your AP Calculus AB test. You are not welcome to retake the test, or, for that matter, ever set foot in an AP class or AP testing area ever again. We at the College Board hope that you have a good rest of your summer. Thank you for understanding.
